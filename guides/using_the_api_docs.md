# Using the API Docs

tags: API

## Introduction

Every gradio interface comes with an API you can use directly. To find out how to use it, just click the `view the api` button at the bottom of the page (whether its hosted on spaces, generated using `share=True`, or running locally).

![view the api button](website/src/assets/img/guides/using_the_api_docs/view-the-api-button.gif)

This button opens up interface-specific API docs. This will show you the predict endpoint, payload, response, as well as sample code snippets in Python, JS and cURL.

# What will the API docs tell you?

Below is an (iframed) example: the API Docs of [this space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/aliabd/nubia).

<iframe src="https://hf.space/gradioiframe/aliabd/nubia/api" frameBorder="5" height="725" title="Gradio app" class="container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe" allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads"></iframe>


It shows that there are 7 sections on the page

* The predict **endpoint**: 
    * Where to send the payload (`https://hf.space/gradioiframe/aliabd/nubia/+/api/predict/`). This is likely the most important piece of information as it defines where the request will be sent.
* The **inputs** and their types
* The **outputs** and their types
* The **payload**: 
    * What to send and how to structure it. It will always look like:
```python
{
    "data": [ input_1, input_2 ... ]
}  
```
* The **response**: 
    * What to expect to receive. It will always look like:
```python
{
    "data": [ output_1, output_2 ... ],
    "durations": [ float ], # the time taken for the prediction to complete
    "avg_durations": [ float ] # the average time taken for all predictions so far (used to estimate the runtime)
}  
```

* A live **demo** and **code snippets** in Python, JS and cURL
    * You can go directly to this section if you want to quickly try out the API and play around with it. 
* Other **methods** related to the inputs/outputs 
    * Use gradio's helper methods to quickly convert your files to base64 and other formats required by the API.


### That's all! Happy building :)
